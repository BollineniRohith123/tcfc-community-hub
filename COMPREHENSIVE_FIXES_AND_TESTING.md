## 🔒 Security Notes

### Existing Security Warnings (Pre-existing, not from migration)

   - Some functions don't have search_path set
   - Not critical but should be addressed
   
2. **Leaked Password Protection Disabled** (WARN)
   - Password leak detection is disabled
   - Consider enabling for production

### RLS Status
✅ All tables have RLS enabled
✅ Proper policies for user/admin access
✅ User roles stored in separate table (secure)
✅ Security definer functions used correctly

## 📋 Admin Dashboard Access

### Creating Superadmin
1. Sign up at `/auth`:
   - Email: `superadmin@gmail.com`
   - Password: `superadmin123`

2. Run this SQL query in backend:
```sql
INSERT INTO public.user_roles (user_id, role)
SELECT id, 'admin'::app_role
FROM auth.users
WHERE email = 'superadmin@gmail.com'
ON CONFLICT (user_id, role) DO NOTHING;
```

3. Log out and log back in
4. Access admin panel at `/admin`
