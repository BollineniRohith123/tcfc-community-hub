# TCFC Community Hub - Implementation Summary

## 🎉 Project Status: READY FOR TESTING

## 📋 What Was Accomplished

### 1. Complete Codebase Analysis ✅
- Analyzed all 8 database tables and their relationships
- Reviewed authentication system (Supabase Auth)
- Understood Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Mapped out all application routes and components
- Identified admin panel structure and features

### 2. Critical Bug Fixes ✅

#### Bug #1: Admin Dashboard Not Accessible
**Problem:** The navbar was checking for a hardcoded email (`admin@tcfc.com`) instead of using the role-based system.

**Solution:** 
- Modified `src/components/Navbar.tsx` to use `isAdmin` flag from `useAuth` hook
- Now any user with admin role in `user_roles` table can access admin panel
- Superadmin (superadmin@gmail.com) can now successfully access admin dashboard

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/Navbar.tsx`

#### Bug #2: Membership Booking Not Implemented
**Problem:** Clicking "Choose Membership" showed "Coming soon" message.

**Solution:**
- Implemented complete membership purchase flow
- Integrated with mock PhonePe payment gateway
- Added payment success/failure pages
- Created user membership records after successful payment

**Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/Memberships.tsx`

**Files Created:**
- `src/pages/PaymentSuccess.tsx`
- `src/pages/PaymentFailed.tsx`

### 3. Mock PhonePe Payment Integration ✅

Created a complete mock payment system for testing without actual PhonePe credentials:

**New Edge Functions:**
- `supabase/functions/phonepe-payment-mock/index.ts` - Initiates mock payment
- `supabase/functions/phonepe-callback-mock/index.ts` - Handles payment callback

**Features:**
- Creates payment records in database
- Generates unique transaction IDs
- Simulates payment success/failure
- Updates booking/membership status after payment
- Redirects to success/failure pages

**How It Works:**
1. User initiates payment (membership or event booking)
2. Mock payment function creates payment record with status "pending"
3. Returns mock payment URL with transaction ID
4. After 2 seconds, redirects to callback URL
5. Callback updates payment status to "success"
6. Creates user membership or confirms event booking
7. Redirects to `/payment-success` page

### 4. Admin Panel Verification ✅

**Tested and Working:**
- ✅ Admin login (superadmin@gmail.com)
- ✅ Admin dashboard with statistics
- ✅ Event management page
- ✅ User management page
- ✅ Payment management page

**Admin Features:**
- View total members, events, revenue, active bookings
- Create, edit, delete events
- View all users and their memberships
- View all payment transactions
- Manage event status (draft/published/cancelled)

### 5. Database Understanding ✅

**Tables (8):**
1. `profiles` - User information (name, email, phone, address)
2. `user_roles` - Role assignments (admin/user)
3. `memberships` - Tier definitions (Gold ₹15k, Diamond ₹30k, Platinum ₹25k)
4. `user_memberships` - User membership records with validity dates
5. `events` - Event details (title, date, venue, capacity, pricing)
6. `event_bookings` - Booking records with attendee count and meal preferences
7. `payments` - Payment transactions with gateway info and status
8. `cms_content` - Content management for pages

**Key Relationships:**
- Users → Profiles (1:1)
- Users → User Roles (1:many)
- Users → User Memberships (1:many)
- Users → Event Bookings (1:many)
- Users → Payments (1:many)
- Events → Event Bookings (1:many)
- Memberships → User Memberships (1:many)
- Event Bookings → Payments (1:1)

**Security:**
- All tables have RLS policies enabled
- Users can only see their own data
- Admins can see all data via `has_role()` function
- Automatic profile creation on signup via trigger
